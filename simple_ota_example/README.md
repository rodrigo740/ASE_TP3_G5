# Simple OTA example

This example is based on `esp_https_ota` component's APIs.

## Configuration

This Project uses the default `python http server` and at first the example `hello world` application is used, but if an update is triggered the `App1 I2C PWM` is downloaded into the ESP32 board. The wifi settings must be changed in order to work in other networks.
