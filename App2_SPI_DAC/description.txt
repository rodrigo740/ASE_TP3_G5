This application writes values from 0x00 to 0x79 in a eeprom memory using SPI. When the application is writing a value in memory it turns a led on and when its dumping the values to the terminal it turns another led on, using DAC for both.
The voltage of the first led varies with the position in which the program is writing, this means that the voltage will vary from 0 to 3.3v (voltage = ((mem_addr*2)*VDD)/ 255), VDD = 3.3v), the voltage of the second led will always be 2.59v (200*3.3/255 = 2.59v).

Pins configuration:

GPIO_CS		13
GPIO_MISO	18
GPIO_MOSI	23
GPIO_SCLK	19

LED_writing = DAC_CHANNEL_1 -> GPIO 25
LED_duping = DAC_CHANNEL_2 -> GPIO 26
