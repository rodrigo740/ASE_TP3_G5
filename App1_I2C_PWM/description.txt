This application reads the values of the temperature sensor using I2C, after each time a value read the mode of operation of the temperature sensor is switched to standby mode. A led is also used with pwm, the duty cycle of this led depends on value from the temperature sensor.

duty = temperature_value/125.0; 
duty = (pow(2, LEDC_DUTY_RES) - 1) * duty, LEDC_DUTY_RES = 13;
